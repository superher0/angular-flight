# AngularJS Developer Challenge

This directory contains the template for a developer challenge that is
part of GoEuro's hiring process.  It is not expected to be useful to
the general public.

# Usage

```
    $ npm install
    $ node app
```
   
The server will then be running on port 3000.  Open 
http://localhost:3000/ to see the file public/index.html.  Go from
there.
